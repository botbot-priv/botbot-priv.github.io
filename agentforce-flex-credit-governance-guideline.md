# ⚖️ Agentforce Flex Credit Governance Guideline

## Purpose
To ensure every Agentforce implementation delivers measurable business value relative to its Flex Credit cost.

1. **Quantify Before You Build**
   
   Before initiating development, estimate both:
   
   - Expected Business Value (e.g., time saved, conversions, revenue uplift)
   - Expected Flex Credit Cost based on model type and usage pattern.
   
   This establishes a baseline ROI expectation.

2. **Select the Right Architecture for the Right Price**

   - Design for value efficiency, not just technical elegance.
   - Use the simplest model and architecture that achieves the business outcome at acceptable performance and accuracy levels.

3. **Prioritize High-ROI Use Cases**

   Focus resources on use-cases where:

   - The value-to-cost ratio is high
   - The impact is visible and measurable
   - The credit consumption is sustainable at scale

4. **Validate and Measure Post-Launch**

   Continuously track:

   - Actual Flex Credit Consumption vs. forecast
   - Realized Business Value vs. projection

   Adjust architecture or usage where ROI diverges from expectations.

5. **Iterate with Governance**

   Incorporate these checkpoints into project governance:

   - Pre-build ROI assessment
   - Post-launch ROI validation
   - Regular optimization reviews
